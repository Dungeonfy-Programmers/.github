### What is Dungeonfy?
Dungeonfy is an MMORPG, but for Minecraft. Its [Discord](https://discord.gg/yhw4ajkCu8) has 678 members at the time of writing, and used to be a thriving (albeit niche) Minecraft server.

It was closed in October 2024, when the server owner (@enookie or "Enook" on Discord) moved on to different things after running the server for almost 4 years.
